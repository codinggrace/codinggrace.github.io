                Coding Grace are a group of developers based in Ireland who love to code and do other geeky and not
                necessarily crafty activities. Some of us code full-time, or just for fun (or both). We have people
                who are part of other technical user groups such as <a href="http://dublinalt.net/">Dublin ALT.NET</a>,
                <a href="http://dublingamecraft.com/">GameCraft</a>, <a href="http://python.ie">Python Ireland</a>,
                <a href="http://www.rubyireland.com/">Ruby Ireland</a> and more…

                We provide female-friendly workshops and events in an environment for developers and aspiring developers
                mentored by majority female instructors.
            </section>
            <section>
                Where many events tend to have more males than females, we aim to encourage many females to come along
                to our workshops and learn to code and more. We also encourage any females who want to mentor technical
                material to help out, it’s not that scary after all.

                It doesn’t matter if you are learning or mentoring, gaining confidence to ask questions, helping others,
                which results in everyone learning from each other gives females in this field the encouragement to
                further their careers, attend technical conferences, or even give a technical talk at one.

                We aim to provide a support network for people from all backgrounds and hope our outreach will help
                bring those who are interested in code development together and learn from one another.

                We also have <a href="https://coding-grace-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">a guide for
                mentors and participants</a>. This is work-in-progress.

            <div class="lead">"I found the format really helpful and engaging. It's great to play around (I love being
                told to break the code) and know that you're not going to reinforce bad habits because you’re still
                within a teaching environment. [&#8230;] thanks for giving me a shot in the arm and spending your Saturday
                engaged in techy altruism." &#8212; Kathryn Daniel, Introduction to Python Workshop (Part 1)</div>
