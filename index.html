                <p>
                    Coding Grace are a group of developers based in Ireland who love to code and do other geeky and not
                    necessarily crafty activities. Some of us code full-time, or just for fun (or both). We have people
                    who are part of other technical user groups such as <a href="http://dublinalt.net/">Dublin ALT.NET</a>,
                    <a href="http://dublingamecraft.com/">GameCraft</a>, <a href="http://python.ie">Python Ireland</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.rubyireland.com/">Ruby Ireland</a> and more…
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide female-friendly workshops and events in an environment for developers and aspiring developers
                    mentored by majority female instructors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where many events tend to have more males than females, we aim to encourage many females to come along
                    to our workshops and learn to code and more. We also encourage any females who want to mentor technical
                    material to help out, it’s not that scary after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn’t matter if you are learning or mentoring, gaining confidence to ask questions, helping others,
                    which results in everyone learning from each other gives females in this field the encouragement to
                    further their careers, attend technical conferences, or even give a technical talk at one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide a support network for people from all backgrounds and hope our outreach will help
                    bring those who are interested in code development together and learn from one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have <a href="https://coding-grace-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">a guide for
                    mentors and participants</a>. This is work-in-progress.

                <h2>Who's Grace?</h2>
                <p>
                    Coding Grace is an homage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>. She is a computer scientist who held one of the highest ranks in the US Navy, the Rear Admiral. She created the term "debug", literally removing a moth from a computer. She also developed COBOL. Another interesting tidbit, she was awarded the inaugural Computer Scientist "Man" of the Year award in 1969 from the Data Processing Management Association. "Amazing Grace" also had a U.S. Navy destroyer named after her called "USS Hopper".
